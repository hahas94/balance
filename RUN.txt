HOW TO RUN:
-----------
This file contains instructions for launching multiple runs and merging the results. It assumes that the command are
run from the project root.

Launching runs:
---------------
- Run a single example with 10 intents:
    Depending on the graph (either `stockholm_medium` or `stockholm_large`), call one of the corresponding shell scripts
    from the command-line as follows:

    >>> bash Balance_Stockholm_Medium.sh 10

This will first create a folder in the results folder named `stockholm_medium_10`,
and then save logs, data and plots to it.

- Run multiple examples with intents starting from 10 and going to 100 intents with steps of 10:
    >>> for i in $(seq 10 10 100); do
    >>> bash Balance_Stockholm_Large.sh $i
    >>> done

- Same as the previous example but assuming running the commands on login node on tetralith:
    >>> for i in $(seq 10 10 100); do
    >>> sbatch Balance_Stockholm_Large.sh $i
    >>> done

- Note that increasing number of intents will require more RAM, so the `--mem` parameter in the shell scripts
  should be modified accordingly.

Merging results:
----------------
Assuming there exists results for 3 runs with the folder names `stockholm_medium_1`, `stockholm_medium_2` and
`stockholm_medium_3`, then for merging the results of these folders into one unified folder do:

    >>> python3 merge_results.py --curr_dir_name=stockholm_medium --merged_dir_name=stockholm_medium_merged --start=1 --stop=3 --step=1

    where the arguments are as follows:
        --curr_dir_name: base name of the subresults folders without extension.
        --merged_dir_name: the name of the unified results' folder.
        --start: the number where the subresults extension number starts from.
        --stop: the number where the subresults extension number stops at, inclusive.
        --steps: the step taken for increasing the results folder name extensions.

    This command will result in a new folder named `stockholm_medium_merged` containg logs, data and plots.
