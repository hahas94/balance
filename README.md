# Balance
Balancing emergency landing location for UTM.

## Description
This repo implements the ideas presented in the paper [insert paper link], that is finding the shortest paths for 
drones while keeping their emergency landing locations balanced. Two different approaches are considered for 
solving this problem, a greedy approach that uses the idea of a time-extended network, and an integer programming 
approach.

## Usage
Define the path to an example json file in the ``main.py`` file and run:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
