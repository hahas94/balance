Explanation of the results in this folder:
------------------------------------------

- This folder contains results for the graph `balance/graphs/stockholm_large.json`.
- It was run on increasing number of intents starting from 10 and going up to 50 with steps of 10.
- The time horizon was 43200s=12h, and time delta was 120s
- The times period from which drone departure is sampled are between layers 0 and halfway through the time horizon.
- The speed of drones was 7 m/s.
- The time uncertainty was a constant, 6*60s.
- The constants used where a runtime of 12h per model and 5% maximum gap.
- The runs where done in parallel for each number of drones, i.e. 10, 20, 30, ... etc. The results of are then merged.
