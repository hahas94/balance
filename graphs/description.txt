File description:
-----------------

This file contains a description of how an example json file is structured,
which is identical to test files as well.

1. Each example or test file is json formatted.
2. It contains 7 variables:
    "start": start time of operations
    "time_horizon": end time of operations planning, in minutes.
    "time_delta": time discretization factor, which divides the planning time into chunks.
    "speed": the speed of all intents, in m/s.

    "nodes": a list of nodes, where each node is an object having the variables
        "name": name of node
         "capacity": capacity of node

    "edges": a list of edges, where each edge is an object having the variables
        "source":  name of source node,
        "destination":  name of destination node
         "weight": weight of edge in meters. Assuming all drones have the same speed.

    "intents": a list of intents, where each intent is an object having the variables
        "source":  name of  source node
        "destination":  name of destination node
        "start": time start of operation
        "uncertainty": time uncertainty in minutes.
